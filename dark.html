            <h1 class="aboutmeheader"><u>My Career Path</u></h1>
            <p class="aboutme">
                When I grow up, I want to have a career that will make me both happy and well-situated in life. There are many options for what I could do, but I have not yet chosen one in particular, although I am leaning towards a job involving math in some form. I have chosen this pathway because I feel like math comes pretty naturally to me and I enjoy it more than other subjects in general. The only thing for certain is that I will have to work hard for this dream to come true. 
            </p>
            <h1 class="aboutmeheader"><u>Why I Chose This Path</u></h1>
            <p class="aboutme">
                The most important characteristic of mine that led me to choose this job pathway was my love for problem solving and working things out. In math, each question is unique, and so you always need to work out the whole problem and see where it leads you. As well as this, I just found math fun in general as, unlike other classes, there is not much memorizing, and it is mostly based off of your own skill.

            <h1 class="aboutmeheader"><u>My Personal Achievements</u></h1>
            <p class="aboutme">
                An achievement that has always stood out to me was that I, atleast so far, have pushed myself to getting straight As in all of my classes. I have made sure to never take classes that were not challenging or engaging for me, and I always made sure I had something to improve upon for myself. In my eyes, without any real goal, there's not much motivation to learn more than you already know, which led me to taking the classes I take today. From many of my experiences in school, I have learned a numerous amount of things. The most impactful of these was that hard work is vital to bettering yourself as a person. I have noticed that whenever I don't strive to learn more in a class, I have less interest in it in general, and do not get as much out of it. Another thing that I have learned is that practice makes all the difference. Even if you are sure you have learned something, it is always better to work out a few more problems and see how you do. It does not hurt to try, and in the end, you will just get more out of it.
            </p>
            <h1 class="aboutmeheader"><u>In Total</u></h1>
            <p class="aboutme">
                Overall, I enjoy working problems out and trying until I succeed. This quality of mine is what motivates me in my classes. Thank you for reading this summary, and if you would like, feel free to explore the rest of my website!
