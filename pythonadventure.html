<p class="smallerheader">
    The first difficulty I had with this project was getting the state machine set up. It was buggy and didn't want to work. I fixed it up by eventually finding out my quoting was off, so I placed an extra one and it was back to working. My second problem was that the quotation marks I used in some of my text interfered with the python code. I had to add back slashes (\) in front of the quotes I wanted ignored so that they didn't interfere. After this, everything worked fine.
